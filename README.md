# ControlledForms

A form library for angular redux apps

## Motivation

In HTML, form elements such as "input" and "textarea" typically maintain their own state and update it based on the user's input,
which breaks redux's unidirectional data flow pattern.
  
This library provides an easy form api solution to handle this “problem” so the component state will remain our application's “single source of truth”.
 
## TODO:
[] add more unit tests.

[] add ci process.

[] little code refactor.

[] little reshape the api (for checkboxes and fieldAdapter interface).

[] create docs.
